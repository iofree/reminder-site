# Subscription Service Agreement

This rule is regarded as a supplementary agreement to the "Member Service Agreement" and is an integral part of it, forming a unified whole with it. If there is a conflict between this rule and the "Member Service Agreement", this rule shall prevail. If you need to use the VIP auto-renewal service, you need to agree to this rule.

You understand and agree:

1. Service Name: Auto-renewal.

2. This service is an auto-renewal service provided to you on the premise that you have already activated the VIP service. If you activate the VIP service, you are deemed to authorize VIP to deduct the monthly fee for the next billing cycle from your iTunes account (hereinafter collectively referred to as "account") balance when your VIP service is about to expire. The premise for the realization of this service is that the deduction can be successfully made from the above account. You shall bear the responsibility for renewal failure caused by insufficient deductible balance in the above account.

VIP has two subscription options to choose from:

- 1 month, automatically renewed every 1 month
- 12 months, automatically renewed every 12 months

3. Accounts that purchase auto-renewal VIP will automatically renew and deduct corresponding fees 24 hours before expiration. If you have activated 1-month VIP auto-renewal and then activate 12-month VIP auto-renewal in the same month, the service will automatically deduct fees from the account before expiration and extend the VIP validity period by 12 months.

4. If you need to cancel auto-renewal, please operate to cancel at least 24 hours in advance. You can stop or terminate this service through the following methods:

Unsubscribe Method 1: In the "Manage My Subscriptions" in the App, cancel the VIP subscription.

Unsubscribe Method 2: Apple in-app purchase (IAP payment, in-app purchase) auto-renewal users can unsubscribe as follows: Open Apple phone "Settings" --> Enter "iTunes Store & App Store" --> Click "Apple ID", select "View Apple ID", enter the "Account Settings" page, click "Subscriptions", select VIP to cancel subscription.

5. The same Apple ID can only activate auto-renewal service for one account.
