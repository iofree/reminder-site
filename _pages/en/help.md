# Never Forget Reminder

Never Forget Reminder is a powerful memo app that provides rich reminder functions and automatic date-time recognition to help users manage time more efficiently.

The app supports multiple reminder methods, including recurring reminders, future reminders, countdown reminders, and lunar calendar reminders.

Users can set reminder times according to their needs, such as daily, monthly, yearly, or specific days of the week. Chinese people often need to celebrate lunar birthdays, so this app also supports lunar birthday reminders.

Users can also enable power reminders to let the app continuously remind users to complete tasks and improve work efficiency.

In addition, the app also supports automatic recognition of date and time in the clipboard, so users can quickly create reminders without manually entering time. At the same time, users can also turn off the clipboard function in settings to ensure personal privacy and security.

Furthermore, the app also supports offline work, with all data stored locally without requiring account registration. This allows users to use the app without an internet connection, further improving work efficiency.

## What is Power Reminder

Power reminder means that when a user has not completed a task, the app will continuously remind the user to complete the task. This reminder method can help users focus more on the current task and avoid forgetting to complete important things due to distraction.
Power reminders can help users be more focused when working or studying, improving efficiency.

## Lunar Calendar Support

The lunar calendar (also called the lunisolar calendar) is a calendar calculated based on the moon's cycle, which is the traditional Chinese agricultural calendar. Many Chinese people still celebrate lunar birthdays, but many apps do not support the lunar calendar because it is different from the Gregorian calendar. Lunar dates change every year on the Gregorian calendar, and leap months may not occur every year.
In Never Forget Reminder, users can set yearly reminders based on the lunar calendar, such as reminding themselves of their lunar birthday every year. The app will automatically calculate leap months and other situations.

## Widgets

Never Forget Reminder supports widgets to display upcoming to-do items and recent yearly reminders (anniversaries, birthdays, etc.), allowing users to conveniently view them on the desktop.
